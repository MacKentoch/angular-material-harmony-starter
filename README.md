Angular material harmony Starter
====

An `angular material` starter written in `ES6` using `jspm`. 

JS an CSS are bundled (*sfx bundled*) so it does not require a server to serve dependencies.

All you need is to include this simple magic :sparkles: bundle :
```javascript
<script type="text/javascript" src="public/js/appBundle.js"></script>
```

___

#start

```shell
npm install  
```

Or if you prefer a server (*not required since sfx bundled*) :

```shell
npm install

gulp connect  
```
